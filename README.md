PROJECT HIGHLIGHT:-

Logic building & fundamentals- finding the greatest of three numbers (c++)
 The purpose of the program is to find the greatest number among three inputs using nested if-else condition
I created the program to streghten my understanding of:
1- Input and output operations
2- Condition logic
3- Nested if-else
4- Basic problem-solving using c++
This program takes three number from the user and compares them step by step to determine the greatest value.
Writting this code helped me understand now logical conditions works in decision making problem.
