PROJECT HIGHLIGHT:-

### finding the greatest of three numbers
 The purpose of the program is to find the greatest number among three inputs using nested if-else condition
I created the program to streghten my understanding of:
1- Input and output operations
2- Condition logic
3- Nested if-else
4- Basic problem-solving using c++
This program takes three number from the user and compares them step by step to determine the greatest value.
Writting this code helped me understand now logical conditions works in decision making problem.

## Object-oriented Programming(oops) 
Iin this section, I am applying OOPs concept like Classes,Object,Encapsulation etc


### ATM Machine System (C++)
This is a simple ATM system implemented in C++ using basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
The project focuses on secure PIN verification and allows withdrawal only after successful authentication.
Proper checks are applied to handle wrong PIN, insufficient balance, and invalid amounts.
This project was created to strengthen my understanding of real-world logic and system design using C++.


### student-result-checker
This is a  *C++ program* I built to manage student results in a simple and clean way.  
It keeps track of each student's *roll number, name, and marks* and automatically tells whether the student has *passed or failed*.

How it Works:- When a student is created, the program checks the marks:
-*40 or more* → Pass  
- *Less than 40* → Fail  
- A *boolean variable* (isPassed) stores this result.  
- The display() function shows the student's details and the result all together.  
  This way, everything is neat and easy to read.

Why I Made This:- I wanted to practice *OOP concepts in C++* and understand how *boolean logic* can be used in real-life situations.  
It's clean, simple, and easy to expand in the future if I want to make a full student management system.

 What Can Be Added Next

- Manage *multiple students* at once  
- Add *grades* like A, B, C, Fail  
- Save and load student records with *file handling*  
- Make a *menu-driven program* for better interaction.
